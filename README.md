# joshuaguy.me Blog

This is my personal blog, located at joshuaguy.me, powered by Wordpress as a Git submodule.  The purpose was to learn how to manage an entire website and its dependencies with Git, and also to create an attractive and functional blog for personal, professional, and academic use.

This site is powered by the following fantastic open-source projects:

* [Wordpress](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress)
* (The fantastic!) [Roots Theme](https://github.com/retlehs/roots)
* [Bootswatch](https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch)
* [FontAwesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome)
* [Disqus Plugin for Wordpress](https://github.com/disqus/disqus-wordpress)
* [highlight.js](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js)
* [HN Button](https://github.com/igrigorik/hackernews-button)
